      "description": "Property Finder provides a collection of APIs that enable you to integrate with our various products and services.\nOur APIs use JSON for request and response bodies and employ standard HTTP response codes. You can consume the APIs directly using any HTTP or REST library.\n\nFor any additional support or questions related to the integration, please contact us at [integration.support@propertyfinder.ae](mailto:integration.support@propertyfinder.ae).\n\n### Usage Restrictions\n\nThis API is intended **strictly for server-to-server communication**.\n- **Do not** use this API directly from frontend applications (e.g., browsers, mobile apps).\n- **Do not** use this API as a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) for public or semi-public client apps.\n- Requests should originate from **secure, server-side environments** only.\n\nThe following sections cover below mentioned topics:\n- [Authentication](#tag/Authentication)\n- [Rate Limiting](#tag/Rate-Limiting) \n"
    },
    {
      "name": "Authentication",
      "description": "When working with the API, you need to pass an access token in the Authorization header of all your requests.\nThis will be in the form of a Bearer token, for example: `Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>`\n\n### Obtaining the token\n\nTo obtain the token, you will need OAuth 2.0 credentials. Your OAuth 2.0 credentials consist of an API Key and an API Secret (corresponding to OAuth 2.0 client ID and client secret).\n\n### Getting OAuth 2.0 credentials\n\nTo get your OAuth 2.0 credentials, open the PF Expert application, and log in. Once you are logged in, navigate to the API Credentials \nsection under the Developer Resources tab in the left sidebar. From here, you can generate a new API key and API secret. Be sure to use the type as `API Integration`.\n\nYou can exchange these for an access token by calling the [Issue JWT Token Endpoint](#tag/Auth/operation/issueToken).\nYou can pass the API key and API secret in the request body.\n\n`API Key` : Your unique client identifier on PF Expert.  \n`API Secret` : Your client secret, used for authentication when requesting an access token.\n\n### Example request\n```sh\ncurl --location 'https://atlas.propertyfinder.com/v1/auth/token' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--header 'Accept: application/json' \\\n--data \n' \n  {\n    \"apiKey\":\"<API_KEY>\",\n    \"apiSecret\":\"<API_SECRET>\"\n  }\n'\n```\n\nThe token server will return a Bearer accessToken in JSON Web Token (JWT) format which you should use in the Authorization header of your API requests.\n\n### Example response\n```json\n{\n  \"accessToken\": \"<ACCESS_TOKEN>\",\n  \"expiresIn\": 1800,\n  \"tokenType\": \"Bearer\"\n}\n```\n\n### Example request\n```sh\ncurl --location 'https://atlas.propertyfinder.com/v1/users?page=1&perPage=15' \\\n--header 'Accept: application/json' \\\n--header 'Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>'\n```\n\nYour access token will be valid for the duration (in seconds) indicated by the `expiresIn` field in the response. When it expires, you'll need to request a new one.\nCurrently, an issued access token will expire in **30 minutes**. Once a token expires, you must request a new one. **No refresh token flow is supported in this integration.**\n\n### Unauthorized Requests\nIf you attempt to access a protected resource without valid authorization you will receive a **401 Unauthorized** or **403 Forbidden** HTTP error.\n```http\n  HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized\n  Content-Type: application/json\n  {\n    \"detail\": \"access denied (decision id: 5593a6df-2c67-4891-bd0a-83f3edfe9b14)\",\n    \"title\": \"Unauthorized\",\n    \"type\": \"AUTHENTICATION\"\n  }\n```\n"

      "name": "Rate Limiting",
      "description": "To ensure fair use and maintain high availability of our APIs, we enforce rate limiting on all requests made to our endpoints.\n\n### Default Rate Limits\n\nUnless otherwise specified, all clients are subject to the following default limits:\n| Request Type                                               | Limit                       | Example Operations                       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| [Issue JWT Token endpoint](#tag/Auth/operation/issueToken) | **60 requests per minute**  | *Issue JWT token*                        |\n| All other endpoints                                        | **650 requests per minute** | *Create user*, *Search Listings*, etc. |\n\n> **Note:** The rate limits are applied per IP address and per client. Other factors may also be considered.\n\nIf you exceed your allotted rate limit:\nYou will receive a **429 Too Many Requests** HTTP response.\nThe request can then be safely retried after some time.\nExample: \n```http\nHTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n* To avoid frequently hitting the rate limit, retry requests using an incremental backoff with jitter.\n* Cache responses for frequently accessed data to reduce duplicate API calls.\n"

      "name": "Publishing a Listing",
      "description": "# General Considerations\n\n- Every listing **must be associated with a Public Profile** representing the identity of a PF Expert user responsible for the listing, as displayed publicly on the Property Finder website. Public profiles are associated with PF Expert users, and can be retrieved using the [[GET] /v1/users](#tag/Users/operation/usersList) endpoint.\n\n- Every listing **must be associated with a valid Location** from Property Finder's location tree.\n\n- The list of **accepted amenities depends on both the Property Type and Category** of the listing.\n  - See country-specific rules below for allowed combinations.\n\n- The listing creation process is split into two steps:\n    - Creating the listing in draft mode ([[POST] /v1/listings](#tag/Listings/operation/listingCreate))\n    - Publishing the listing ([[POST] /v1/listings/{id}/publish](#tag/Listings/operation/listingPublish))\n\n# High-Level Flow\n\n1. **Obtain Public Profile Id**  \n   Call [[GET] /v1/users](#tag/Users/operation/usersList) to retrieve available users and their public profiles. select the appropriate `publicProfile.id`.\n   ```\n    {\n     \"publicProfile\": {\n       \"id\": 216582,\n       ...\n      }\n      ...\n    }\n   ```\n\n2. **Obtain Location ID**  \n   Call [[GET] /v1/locations?search=Marina](#tag/Locations/operation/locationsList) to retrieve the valid location and obtain the correct `id`.\n   ```\n      {\n        \"data\": [\n          {\n            \"coordinates\": {\n              \"lat\": 25.078367,\n              \"lng\": 55.14041\n            },\n            \"id\": 50,\n            \"name\": \"Dubai Marina\",            \n            ...\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n   ```\n\n\n3. **Create Listing (Draft Mode)**  \n   Call ([[POST] /v1/listings](#tag/Listings/operation/listingCreate)) to create a new listing in draft state, providing the required data including `publicProfileId` and `locationId`. The response will return the newly created `listingId`.\n\n4. (**_Optional_**) **Get Publishing Price**  \n   Call [[GET] /v1/listings/{id}/publish/prices](#tag/Listings/operation/listingPublishPrices) to retrieve the price to publish the listing.\n\n5. **Publish Listing**  \n   Call [[POST] /v1/listings/{id}/publish](#tag/Listings/operation/listingPublish) to publish the listing and make it publicly available on the Property Finder website.\n\n6. **Listing Publish Flow**\n\n> **Note:** Listing publishing is an **asynchronous process**.  \n> A `200 OK` response only confirms that the **request was received**, **not** that the listing was successfully published.\n\n**Recommended Flow:**\n\n1. **Subscribe to the Publish Webhook**\n  - Subscribe to the [Publish Webhook](#tag/Events/operation/wh.listing.published).  \n  - This webhook notifies you when a listing has been successfully published.\n\n2. **Publish the listing**\n  - Send a `POST` request to publish the listing by calling the [Publish Listing Endpoint](#tag/Listings/operation/listingPublish).\n  - You will receive an immediate `200` OK response (request accepted).\n\n3. **Wait for Webhook Notification**\n  - If you receive a **success notification** within **30 seconds**, the listing is confirmed as published.\n\n4. **Verify Listing API if Needed**\n  - If **no webhook notification** is received within **30–60 seconds**, call the **GET Listing API** to verify the current listing status.\n\n**Common Pitfall:**\n- Do not mark listings as *created* immediately after receiving a `200` OK response.  \n- In some cases, the listing may **fail to publish**, leading to inconsistencies between CRM system and PF Expert.  \n- Implementing the above flow helps ensure accurate status tracking and resolves `missing listings` issues.\n\n\n\n\n# Compliance PF Expert ⇄ API Field Name Mapping\n\nThe following table shows how field names differ between the UI and the API\nfor **Dubai** and **ADREC (Abu Dhabi)** contexts:\n\n| PF Expert Label | API Field Name | Context |\n|-----------|----------------|----------|\n| Real Estate Company License Number | `issuingClientLicenseNumber` | Dubai |\n| RERA Permit Number | `listingAdvertisementNumber` | Dubai |\n| Broker License Number | `issuingClientLicenseNumber` | ADREC (Abu Dhabi) |\n| ADREC Permit Number | `listingAdvertisementNumber` | ADREC (Abu Dhabi) |\n\n# Region-Specific Flows\n\n## UAE\n\n### DUBAI\n  To ensure compliance with the **Dubai Land Department's (DLD)** regulations, particularly under the DLD Strict Adherence initiative, it's imperative that all property listings on Property Finder accurately reflect the details registered with the DLD. This includes critical information such as price, property type, and location.  \n  To facilitate this, our Enterprise API provides a structured workflow that mandates the retrieval of official permit details before creating or updating any listing.\n\n### Special Business Rules\n\n- Dubai Land Department (DLD) compliance is mandatory for listings in Dubai.\n- Permit ID and License Number must be obtained before creating or updating listings.\n- Listing verification is automatically triggered after publishing.\n- Listings located within DIFC and JAFZA are exempt from DLD compliance and permit validation.\n- Only developer clients may use project-level permits to publish listings; brokers must obtain unit-level permits.\n\n\n### High-Level UAE Flow (Dubai-specific)\n\n  1. Retrieve Public Profile ID ([[GET] /v1/users](#tag/Users/operation/usersList))\n  2. Retrieve Location ID ([[GET] /v1/locations](#tag/Locations/operation/locationsList))\n  3. Retrieve Permit Details ([[GET] /v1/compliances/{permitNumber}/{licenseNumber}](#tag/Compliances/operation/compliancesGet))\n  4. Create Listing ([[POST] /v1/listings](#tag/Listings/operation/listingCreate) with permit and license details\n  5. Publish Listing ([[POST] /v1/listings/{id}/publish](#tag/Listings/operation/listingPublish))\n  6. Listing Verification is triggered automatically\n\n\n\n#### Step 3 — Retrieve Official Permit Details\n\n- **Endpoint:** [[GET] /v1/compliances/{permitNumber}/{licenseNumber}](#tag/Compliances/operation/compliancesGet)\n- **Required Parameters:**\n    - `permitType`\n    - `permitNumber`\n    - `licenseNumber` (company license number)\n- **Purpose:** Retrieve latest official DLD permit data to ensure that the listing aligns with official records.\n- **Why:** Prevent discrepancies in critical fields like price, location, and property type. Any discrepancies between your listing and the DLD data can lead to listing rejection or legal complications.\n\n##### DLD Listing Type Enforcement\n\nFrom the compliance response, extract data[].property.listingType.\n\nThis value defines the official property classification and must be mapped to a valid **type** when creating a listing.\n\n##### Mapping: listingType → allowed **listing type** values\n  | DLD Listing Type | Allowed Listing Type Values |\n  |------------------|-----------------------------|\n  | Unit | Apartment, Duplex, Full Floor, Half Floor, Penthouse, Hotel Apartment |\n  | Villa | Villa, Townhouse, Bungalow| \n  | Building | Compound, Whole Building, Bulk Units, Labor Camp, Office space, Retail, Shop, Showroom, Warehouse, Factory, Business Center, Coworking spaces, Staff Accommodation | \n  | Land | Land, Farm, Villa, Townhouse, Bungalow, Whole Building |\n\n##### Example:\nIf DLD listingType = \"Unit\", valid **listing type** values include:\n  \"Apartment\", \"Duplex\", \"Penthouse\", etc.\n\n\n#### Step 4 — Create Listing\n- Use retrieved permit data to populate all regulated fields.\n- Ensure that the **listing type** matches the value allowed by the DLD listingType\n\n#### Best Practices\n- Always use the most recent data obtained from the compliance endpoint to populate your listing.\n- Avoid manual alterations to critical fields like price or property type without first updating them with the DLD and retrieving the new permit details.\n- Ensure that all mandatory fields are accurately filled to prevent listing rejections.\n\n#### Ongoing Maintenance and Updates\n\n- Price or Detail Changes: Before making any changes to listing details via the API, ensure the information is first updated with the DLD. Once updated, use the `GET /v1/compliances/` endpoint to retrieve the latest permit details and then update your listing accordingly.\n- Regular Verification: Periodically verify that your listings remain consistent with DLD records, especially if there are changes in regulations or property details.\n\n### ABU DHABI\n  In Abu Dhabi, compliance is handled under the **Abu Dhabi Real Estate Center (ADREC)**.  \n  ADREC enforces the presence and validity of the ADREC permit before listings can go live.\n  \n  #### Special Business Rules\n  - ADREC compliance is mandatory for listings in Abu Dhabi.\n  - Client type must be one of: **broker**, **property_management**, or **developer**.\n  - Sub-permit rules apply: if the given permit has sub-permits, the correct sub-permit must be provided in the request. Only one (sub)permit can be used per live listing.\n  - Listing verification must be applied **manually after creation**, with supporting documents provided.\n\n# Region-Specific Rules\n\n## UAE –

      "description": "## Overview\nWebhooks are HTTP callbacks that are triggered by specific events in the system. They allow you to receive real-time notifications about changes or actions that occur within the system, such as lead creation, updates, or other relevant events.\n\nWebhooks are typically used to integrate with external systems or services, enabling you to automate workflows and respond to events as they happen.\n\nFor example, when a new lead is created, a webhook can be triggered to send the lead data to an external CRM system or notify a third-party service.\n\nWebhooks are configured to send HTTP POST requests to a specified URL, containing relevant data about the event that occurred. This allows you to process the data in real-time and take appropriate actions based on the received information.\n\n### Subscription Multiplicity\n\nIt is possible to create multiple subscriptions for the same event type. \nEach subscription operates independently and will receive a separate delivery when the corresponding event is emitted.\n\n## Security\n### HMAC Signature\n\nIf a **secret** was defined during the event subscription setup, each event delivery will include an HMAC-SHA256 signature.\n\n- The signature is computed using the full **event payload** as input and the provided secret as the key.\n- The resulting signature is sent in the `X-Signature` HTTP header as a hexadecimal string.\n- This allows subscribers to verify the authenticity and integrity of the event payload.\n\nIf no secret is defined, the signature header will be omitted.\n"

To get only the Dubai Hills Estate location, set the `filter[parent]` as \"Dubai, Dubai Hills Estate\", this specifies the complete location hierarchy from country/emirate down to the immediate area as comma separated fields.\n"
